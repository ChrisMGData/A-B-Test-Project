# A-B-Test-Project

In this project we are required to analize the results of an A/A/B test and inform according to statistically relevant information if the test may continue or be stopped.

The analysis and visualizations were coded in Python, using libraries as matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, numpy, scipy and pandas.
